HomoCrypto
==========

This is an implementation of a Fully Homomorphic Encryption System over the Integers in Python. All of the workings for our website and the scripts we use to distribute a word count using hadoop's map-reduce and dfs. 

The current (unfinished) website is http://homocrypto.acm.wwu.edu:8080/ (works best in Firefox)
