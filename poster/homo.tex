\begin{slide}{Abstract}

We present a formal inquiry of the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme proposed by Craig Gentry in 2008. Moreover we introduce the first implementation of this cipher in the Python programming language. A fully homomorphic encryption scheme enables the execution of arbitrary operations on encrypted data without the decryption key which, put simply, allows for a third party to  store and manipulate sensitive information without the ability to interpret it. 
\parskip 1em

The applications of an efficient fully homomorphic encryption system are potentially limitless. A contemporary example is cloud based email, where a decentralized server stores and serves encrypted user email. Furthermore, such a system would allow for users to request the server to perform search queries on stored data without loss of privacy. This is a particularly enticing scenario given the recent boom in portable devices and multiparty computation, both of which currently have serious security concerns. 

Our investigation includes a high level synopsis of the mathematics involved in fully homomorphic encryption, a complete demonstration of our implementation in Python, and finally a overview of the space and asymptotic time complexities of the proposed system.

\begin{slide}{Security}

Given \(\lambda\) as a security Parameter 

we have a private key space of \(2^{(\lambda^2-2)} - (2^{\lambda^{2-1}})-1\)

The cryptographic hint uses the subset sum problem over a sparse subset. cracking the hint takes up space 

\[\left(\begin{matrix}\beta = \lambda^5\\\alpha \end{matrix}\right)\approx \beta^\alpha\] produces


The problem of cracking is {\em Soft NP-Complete}

This is because as the security parameters grows, the searchspace and the cost of the operations grow.
